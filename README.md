# lab3(B)
the result of page21/22(insectionsort)when the vector's sizes = 1000 is 0.00635 s
the result of lab3 then the vector's size = 1000 is 0.00197s

the result of page21/22(insectionsort)when the vector's sizes = 10000 is 0.8659 s
the result of lab3 then the vector's size = 10000 is 0.0293s

the result of page21/22(insectionsort)when the vector's sizes = 100000 is 43.7742 s
the result of lab3 then the vector's size = 100000 is 1.5904s

the result of page21/22(insectionsort)when the vector's sizes = 1000000 is 4316.9816 s
the result of lab3 then the vector's size = 1000000 is 44.6742s

so, from the result we can see that the function of page 21 and 22 is not suitable for sorting a large vector.
